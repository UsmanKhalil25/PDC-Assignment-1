### **Hypothesis and Analysis**

#### **1. Is Speedup Linear?**

- The speedup is **not linear** with the number of threads. For example:
  - In **View 1**, the speedup for 3 threads (1.63×) is lower than for 2 threads (1.93×), indicating inefficiency.
  - In **View 2**, speedup increases more consistently but still deviates from linearity.

#### **2. Why Isn't Speedup Linear?**

- **Hardware Limitations**: The processor has **4 cores** with **2 hyper-threads per core**, allowing up to 8 threads. However, hyper-threading does not double performance due to shared execution resources.
- **Load Imbalance**: Uneven work distribution among threads can leave some threads idle, especially evident in the **3-thread case**.
- **Overhead**: Thread management (e.g., context switching, synchronization) increases with more threads, reducing performance gains.

---

### **Graph Analysis**

#### **View 1**:

- Speedup increases significantly from 2 to 4 threads, reflecting better utilization of the 4 cores.
- Beyond 4 threads, speedup continues but at a slower rate due to hyper-threading overhead and diminishing returns.

#### **View 2**:

- Speedup increases more consistently, suggesting better load balancing or less overhead compared to View 1.
- The 3-thread case still shows a drop, but it is less pronounced than in View 1.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Speedup is not linear** due to hardware limitations, load imbalance, and thread management overhead.
- The **3-thread case** is particularly affected by load imbalance, as one thread may handle more work than others.
- Measuring individual thread execution times can help confirm these observations and identify opportunities for better load balancing.

## **Problem 2: Vectorization Analysis**

| Vector Width | Total Vector Instructions | Vector Utilization | Utilized Vector Lanes | Total Vector Lanes |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| 2            | 172724                    | 88.2%              | 304828                | 345448             |
| 4            | 99572                     | 83.2%              | 331248                | 398288             |
| 8            | 54124                     | 80.5%              | 348600                | 432992             |
| 16           | 28214                     | 79.3%              | 357816                | 451424             |

### **Key Observations**

- Vector utilization **decreases** as the vector width increases.
- **Reason**: Wider vectors are more likely to have underutilized lanes, especially during tail iterations or when processing elements requiring varying computation steps. For example, in data-dependent loops (e.g., clamped exponent calculations), some elements may finish earlier, leaving lanes inactive.

## **Problem 3: Expected Speedup in Mandelbrot SIMD Execution**

### **Part 1: Single-Core ISPC**

```bash
[mandelbrot serial]:            [283.330] ms
[mandelbrot ispc]:              [56.030] ms
                               (5.06x speedup from ISPC)
```

#### **Explanation**

- The theoretical maximum speedup using 8-wide AVX2 SIMD instructions is **8×**.
- **Observed Speedup (~5×)**:
  - **SIMD Divergence**: Pixels require varying iteration counts, causing some SIMD lanes to wait for the slowest lane.
  - **Workload Imbalance**: Regions near fractal boundaries have non-uniform computation, reducing SIMD utilization.
  - **Overhead Costs**: Vector setup and masking introduce additional overhead.

---

### **Part 2: Multicore ISPC with Tasks**

#### **a) Default Execution**

```bash
[mandelbrot serial]:            [283.597] ms
[mandelbrot ispc]:              [56.144] ms
[mandelbrot multicore ispc]:    [28.137] ms
                               (10.08x speedup from task ISPC)
```

- The multicore ISPC version achieves a **10.08x speedup** over the serial version, completing in **28.137 ms**.
- It is **2x faster** than the single-core ISPC version, demonstrating the benefits of multicore parallelism.

#### **b) Optimized Execution**

```bash
[mandelbrot serial]:            [283.225] ms
[mandelbrot ispc]:              [55.826] ms
[mandelbrot multicore ispc]:    [9.387] ms
                               (30.17x speedup from task ISPC)
```

- Further optimization achieves a **30.17x speedup**, highlighting the potential of combining SIMD and multicore parallelism.

## Problem 4: Iterative Square Root Speedup Analysis

## 1. Measured Speedup and Breakdown

Using your three sets of logs, we can compare three different cases. (Note that the “random case” log is representative of typical behavior.)

### Example (Random Case)

- **Serial:** 737.297 ms
- **ISPC (no tasks):** 195.012 ms → Speedup ≈ 737.297 / 195.012 ≈ **3.78×**
- **ISPC with tasks:** 37.154 ms → Speedup ≈ 737.297 / 37.154 ≈ **19.84×**

**Interpretation:**

- **SIMD (single‑core) speedup:** The non‑task ISPC version shows a speedup of about 3.78×. This represents the benefit of vectorizing the computation on one core (i.e. the effect of executing 8‑wide AVX2 instructions on “uniform” work across lanes).
- **Multi‑core (task) speedup:** When using tasks to run on all cores, the overall speedup is 19.84×. In other words, compared to the non‑task version, tasks bring an extra factor of roughly 195.012 / 37.154 ≈ **5.25×** benefit due to multi‑core parallelization.

### Variation With Different Inputs

- **Max‑case log (uniform “hard” input):**

  - Serial: 1370.309 ms
  - ISPC (no tasks): 302.379 ms → Speedup ≈ **4.53×**
  - ISPC with tasks: 54.631 ms → Speedup ≈ **25.08×**
  - _Additional note:_ Here, the SIMD speedup is 4.53× and the extra benefit from multi‑core parallelism (302.379/54.631) is about **5.53×**.

- **Min‑case log (imbalanced input):**
  - Serial: 189.175 ms
  - ISPC (no tasks): 259.073 ms → Speedup ≈ **0.73×** (i.e. slower than serial)
  - ISPC with tasks: 64.839 ms → Speedup ≈ **2.92×**

Thus, the **SIMD benefit alone** (non‑tasks) varies from being beneficial (≈4.5× speedup) to detrimental (≈0.73×) depending on the input. The **overall multi‑core speedup** (tasks) varies similarly—from about 19.8× up to 25× in the best case, while in the worst case it’s only about 2.92×.

---

## 2. Maximizing Relative Speedup

**Goal:** Maximize both SIMD and multi‑core benefits.

**Strategy:**  
– Use an input where every element requires many iterations (i.e. “hard” work) and the work is uniform across all SIMD lanes.  
– For example, set every element to a value very near the upper bound of the convergence region (such as **2.998f**).

**Implementation Example:**

```cpp
for (unsigned int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    values[i] = 2.998f;  // All values force many iterations and uniform work.
}
```

**Results (from your max‑case log):**

- Serial: 1370.309 ms
- ISPC (no tasks): 302.379 ms → Speedup ≈ **4.53×**
- ISPC with tasks: 54.631 ms → Speedup ≈ **25.08×**

**Analysis:**  
– **SIMD Speedup Improvement:** Because every lane processes the same “hard” value, there’s no divergence; all lanes take a similar number of iterations. This yields a higher SIMD (single‑core) speedup (≈4.53× instead of only 3.78× or worse).  
– **Multi‑core Speedup Improvement:** With a heavy, uniform workload, the cost of task scheduling is amortized over many iterations, and the work is well balanced across cores—resulting in a strong additional speedup factor (≈5.5× extra over non‑task ISPC).

---

## 3. Minimizing ISPC Speedup (Worsening SIMD Efficiency)

**Goal:** Create an input that causes significant divergence among SIMD lanes, thereby reducing (or even negating) the benefit of vectorization.

**Strategy:**  
– Force an imbalance within each 8‑wide SIMD group so that most lanes finish very quickly while one lane takes many iterations.  
– One approach is to set almost all values to one that converges immediately (e.g. **1.0f**), except for one lane in every group of 8 (e.g. at indices that are multiples of 8), set to a “hard” value (e.g. **2.998f**).

**Implementation Example:**

```cpp
for (unsigned int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (i % 8 == 0)
        values[i] = 2.998f;  // Requires many iterations.
    else
        values[i] = 1.0f;    // Converges almost immediately.
}
```

**Expected/Observed Performance (from your min‑case log):**

- Serial: 189.175 ms
- ISPC (no tasks): 259.073 ms → Speedup ≈ **0.73×** (ISPC version is slower than serial)
- ISPC with tasks: 64.839 ms → Speedup ≈ **2.92×**

**Analysis:**  
– **Loss in SIMD Efficiency:** In each SIMD vector of 8 lanes, only one lane is “busy” (processing 2.998f) while the other seven finish almost instantly (processing 1.0f). This imbalance forces the entire SIMD instruction to wait for the slow lane to complete.  
– **Overhead Domination:** The benefits of SIMD are largely lost due to masking and divergence overhead; hence the ISPC non‑task version runs slower than serial.  
– **Multi‑core Impact:** Although multi‑core parallelism (via tasks) still helps to some extent by balancing work among cores, the fundamental inefficiency of the SIMD part limits the overall speedup.

---

## Summary

- **Measured Speedups:**  
  – With a typical (random) input, ISPC (no tasks) gives about 3.78× speedup (SIMD benefit) and ISPC with tasks gives about 19.84× overall speedup.  
  – With a “hard” (uniform) input, the SIMD speedup improves to roughly 4.53× and overall (with tasks) to about 25.08×.  
  – With an imbalanced input (most values easy, one hard per SIMD group), the ISPC (no tasks) version can perform worse than serial (0.73×), while tasks bring the speedup only to about 2.92×.

- **Maximizing Speedup:**  
  – Use a uniform input (e.g. all values set to 2.998f) to maximize arithmetic intensity and minimize divergence. This improves both the SIMD efficiency and the multi‑core scaling because all lanes and cores perform nearly identical work.

- **Minimizing Speedup:**  
  – Use a mixed input (e.g. values set to 1.0f for 7 out of every 8 elements and 2.998f for the remaining one) to force divergence within each SIMD group. This imbalance causes inefficient utilization of SIMD lanes, resulting in a relative slowdown (ISPC no tasks runs slower than serial) and greatly reduced overall speedup.

This breakdown shows that both the nature of the input and how uniformly the workload is distributed across SIMD lanes (and then across cores) critically affect the achievable speedup in the ISPC implementations.

## **Problem 5: SAXPY Performance Analysis**

```bash
[saxpy ispc]:           [14.870] ms     [20.041] GB/s   [2.690] GFLOPS
[saxpy task ispc]:      [14.220] ms     [20.958] GB/s   [2.813] GFLOPS
                               (1.05x speedup from use of tasks)
```

### **Performance Analysis**

- **ISPC Without Tasks**: Achieves high memory bandwidth utilization (~20.04 GB/s) through SIMD vectorization.
- **ISPC With Tasks**: Adds multicore parallelism but only achieves a **1.05x speedup**, indicating the workload is **memory-bound**.

### **Can Performance Be Substantially Improved?**

- **No**, near-linear speedup is unlikely because:
  - SAXPY is **memory-bound**, and SIMD already maximizes per-core memory throughput.
  - Adding more cores does not alleviate the memory bandwidth bottleneck.
